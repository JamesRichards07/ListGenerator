# ListGenerator

## Overview
This project was created by my need for a tool where I could randomly assign a list of individuals a provided list of items. 

User stories:
- Parents assigning their children a weekly list of chores.
- Mangager in fast food/retail deciding what area of the store each employee will be assigned during their shift. 
- Friends wanting to designate player turn order for their favorite table top game.
